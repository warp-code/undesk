# Undesk - Video Script
**Total Runtime: ~3.5 minutes**

---

## INTRO (30 seconds)

### [Screen: Landing page hero with animated background]

**Voiceover:**
> "Hi all, I'm Paula and today I'm presenting Undesk, a private, peer-to-peer, OTC trading desk on Solana.
  The problem it solves is simple: when you trade large amounts on the blockchain, everyone can see these trades and react to them.
  With Undesk, your price and size stay always encrypted. Neither side ever learns what the other was willing to pay or how much."

### [Screen: Click "Launch App" to transition to trading interface]

> "Let me show you how it works."

---

## DEMO: THE INTERFACE (30 seconds)

### [Screen: OTC trading page - overview shot]

> "This is the trading interface. You have three views: Open Market to see all availabe deals, Your Deals for the deals you've created, and Your Offers to track bids you've placed."

### [Screen: Briefly show each tab]

> "Let's create a deal."

---

## DEMO: CREATING A DEAL (60 seconds)

### [Screen: Focus on Create Deal form]

**Voiceover:**
> "I want to sell 100 META for USDC. I set my price at 6 USDC per token. This is my minimum. I'll keep it open for 15 minutes and allow partial fills."

**ALT VOICEOVER:**
> "I want to sell 150 META for USDC. I set my price at 6 USDC per token. This is my minimum. I'll keep it open for 15 minutes and allow partial fills."

### [Screen: Click "Create Deal" button, wait for loading]

> "I click on "Submit Deal", derive my private keypairs, sign my transaction... and it's live."

### [Screen: Click "Your Deals" tab, show the new deal]

> "Here's my deal under Your Deals. When I click on it I see its full details because it's mine. But the market? They see none of this. They only know I'm selling META for USDC. I can also share a direct link to this deal. Anyone with the link lands right here and they can make their offer."

### [Screen: Hover over status/offer count area]

> "As offers come in, I'll see the count tick up. But I won't see individual prices or sizes."

---

## DEMO: MAKING AN OFFER (60 seconds)

### [Screen: Click "Open Market" tab]

**Voiceover:**
> "Now the other side. Here's the open market showing deals from other traders."


### [Screen: Click on a META/USDC deal row]

> "I'll click this META/USDC deal. Three offers already, expires in a couple of minutes. Still no price or size visible."

### [Screen: Point to Make Offer form]

> "The form switches to Make Offer. I want 100 META, and I'm willing to pay 7 USDC per token. My total: 700 USDC."

### [Screen: Fill in and submit]

> "If my price beats the creator's threshold, I get filled. If not, neither of us learns what the other wanted."

### [Screen: Show redirect to "Your Offers" tab, pending status]

> "Submitted. Status: pending. I wait for the deal to close to find out."

### [Screen: Show deal creator's view of their deal with 1 new offer]

> "Back to the deal creator's view, I can see that I now have 1 offer on my deal."

---

## DEMO: DEAL RESOLUTION (45 seconds)

### [Screen: Show a deal that's about to expire or manually trigger expiry]

**Voiceover:**
> "Now let's see what happens when a deal closes. This one just expired."

### [Screen: Show the deal creator's view - Your Deals tab with updated status]

> "From the creator's side: I see my deal settled and how much got filled. But I don't see the individual offers that matched. I don't know their prices or how much they offered."

### [Screen: Switch to the offeror's view - Your Offers tab with updated statuses]

> "From the offeror's side: I see my offer status: filled, partially filled, or unfilled, and how much executed. But I never learn the creator's price or total size."

### [Screen: Highlight both views side by side or toggle between them]

> "Both sides see their own results. Neither side sees the other's parameters. The MPC network matches and settles without exposing anything beyond your personal fill."

---

## DEMO: HOW PRIVACY WORKS (30 seconds)

### [Screen: Return to landing page, scroll to MPC security visualization]

**Voiceover:**
> "All of Undesk's state and execution runs on Arcium's MPC network. Deals and offers flow in encrypted. When the deal expires, a crank runs and the network compares them without decrypting. You only learn if your trade succeeded or failed while everything else stays private. I didn't have to deposit my money with a third party or make my intentions known - the protocol handled everything for me."

---

## CLOSE (20 seconds)

### [Screen: Hero section or logo]

**Voiceover:**
> "That's Undesk. Private OTC trading where your strategy stays yours. Connect a wallet and try it—or reach out if you're moving serious size."

### [Screen: Fade to logo]

> "Undesk. Trade without revealing."
